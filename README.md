# slab
A full webapp, running on your desktop.

Slab is a sample application that you can extend to make a webapp that runs on a desktop.
The browser is connected to the server via localhost. Deploying is just running the `run.py` file
and seeing the browser open to the `localhost:8080` page.

Slab will detect when the host has been closed, and display a message asking the user to start it again.

Slab was built with Python's bottle framework.
